#### Interactive Mapmaking and Historical Data Visualization for the 21st Century, Made Simple.

\-

Naissance is a new type of GIS that makes it possible to utilize raster tools on vector maps. The ultimate goal is to create a modernized tool for data visualization and mapmaking where you can create interactive atlases, different mapmodes, and export maps as video/3D- all w/ a UI so simple a toddler could use it.

We're still a long way from that goal, but join us on that journey!
